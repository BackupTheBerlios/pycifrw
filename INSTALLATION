PyCiFRW installation
====================

Unpack the distribution to a location where Python can find it
(eg .../lib/Python2.0/site-packages/PyCifRW in Unix, or
    C:\Python2.0\Lib\PyCifRW  in Windows)

Under Unix, you should then add a file 'PyCifRW.pth' in the
lib/Python2.0/site-packages directory containing the single line
'PyCifRW'

Problems
========

Most of the files in the distribution have Unix-style line endings.
This may cause strange problems on Macintosh systems.
