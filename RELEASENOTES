Release Notes for PyCIFRW-3.1
=============================

PyCifRW-3.1 is mostly a bug-fix release. 
 
Bug fixes (since 3.0)
=====================

* deepcopy failed when copying CifFile objects due to the
way the __iter__ method was set.  This has been fixed.

* Data values which began with an apostrophe or quotation
mark were not necessarily put inside quotes when output, leading to
potential corruption of the output file. 

Improvements/Changes (since 3.0)
================================

* A compiled tokenizer is now available to increase speed of file
input.  The option 'scantype="flex"' should be passed to the 
ReadCif/ReadStar commands.  Error reporting is minimal.

Incompatible changes (since 3.0)
================================

None
