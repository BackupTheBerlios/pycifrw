Release Notes for PyCIFRW-3.1.1
===============================

PyCifRW-3.1.1 is mostly a bug-fix release. 
 
Bug fixes (since 3.0)
=====================

* deepcopy failed when copying CifFile objects due to the
way the __iter__ method was set.  This has been fixed.

* Data values which began with an apostrophe or quotation
mark were not necessarily put inside quotes when output, leading to
potential corruption of the output file. 

(3.1.1)
* Replacing items in a loop could cause a duplicate item error to
be raised, instead of silently replacing the item

* Loop validation has been broken since 2.0. This should now work
properly

* _category_mandatory checking behaved differently to that described
in the journal article; this has been fixed

Improvements/Changes (since 3.0)
================================

* A compiled tokenizer is now available to increase speed of file
input.  The option 'scantype="flex"' should be passed to the 
ReadCif/ReadStar commands.  Error reporting is minimal.

* Method ChangeItemOrder added to allow moving item position in the
output file

(3.1.1)
* A simple CIF server for doing validation reporting is now bundled

Incompatible changes (since 3.0)
================================

None
