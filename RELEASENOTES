Release Notes for PyCIFRW-3.0
=============================

This is a beta release of PyCifRW-3.0.  It differs
from previous releases in that all CIF objects are
now derived from StarFile objects. 
 
Bug fixes (since 2.0)
=====================

* Data values of '' (empty string) caused crashing.  This
has been fixed (thanks Anders Madsen).

Improvements/Changes
====================

* CifFile/CifBlock/CifLoopBlock objects are now based on
the corresponding Star objects.

* Order is mostly preserved when writing out CIF files, 
and loop positioning in the enclosing data block can be 
specified (see method 'insert_loop').  Save frames will
always appear at the top of a block, however.

* Iterators (flat_iterator, recursive_iter) are provided
for looping over all packets in a loop

* If a number is provided to a CifLoopBlock object instead of 
a dataname, that packet number is returned.

Incompatible changes
====================

The following changes may break existing code:

* Loop blocks are now accessible as separate objects. The
method 'GetLoop' now returns a CifLoopBlock object, which
will break existing code using this method.

* The CifBlock method "loops()" now returns a list of
CifLoopBlock objects
