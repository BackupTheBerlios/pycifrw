Introduction
------------

PyCIFRW provides basic support for reading and writing CIF (Crystallographic
Information Format) files.  It was developed at the ANBF (Australian
National Beamline Facility) as part of a larger project to provide CIF
input/output capabilities to visiting users.

Files
-----

PyCiFRW consists of the following files:

CifFile.py                     Defines the CifFile module
CifFile.nw                     Noweb file from which CifFile.py is obtained
CifFile.html                   Programming notes for CifFile

Makefile                       How to derive .html and .py files from .nw files
kjCParseBuild.py               Somewhat enhanced part of the kjParsing package
kjCParser.py                   Somewhat enhanced part of the kjParsing package
kwCifParse.py                  Cif grammar specifications for kjParsing
kwCifParse.html                Programming notes for kwCifParse
kwCifParse.nw                  Noweb file

Installation
------------

All .py files should be placed in a directory where python can find them, for
example .../lib/python/site-packages

Use
---

See the text in CifFile.html for details of the interface

Example
-------

To read in a CIF:
>> from CifFile import *
>> cf = CifFile('jun_01_2.cif','si_std')
>> wav = cf.GetCifItem('_diffrn_meas_wavelength')
