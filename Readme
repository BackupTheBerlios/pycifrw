                          PyCIFRW Readme
                          --------------

Introduction
------------

PyCIFRW provides basic support for reading and writing CIF (Crystallographic
Information Format) files using Python.  It was developed at the Australian
National Beamline Facility (ANBF), run by the Australian Synchrotron Research
Program (ASRP), as part of a larger project to provide CIF input/output 
capabilities for data collection.  It is currently (Sept 2001) under active 
development and testing.  

Conformance
-----------

The draft BNC specification for CIF files was used as a reference, and
in most cases the grammar and character sets specified there were copied
directly.

PyCifRW has been tested on the IUCr sample CIF trap files, and fails or 
successfully reads as it is supposed to.    Attempts to add an overlength  
dataname to a CIF file currently resident in memory will result in an error.
Output lines do not exceed 80 characters. If a data value is supplied
with a length of more than 80 characters (including carriage returns) the
program will attempt to split the string at the carriage returns (doing the
requisite CIF formatting), otherwise it will break at whitespace.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

PyCIFRW is written entirely in Python.  While this makes parsing of large
CIF files rather slow, it will run wherever Python runs.  It has been
tested on Unix (Linux,Solaris) and Windows 95/98 under Python 1.5.2 and
Python 2.0.  Macintoshes will probably have trouble with the Unix-style line 
termination of the .py files.

Files
-----

PyCiFRW consists of the following files:

Original files:

CifFile.py                     Defines the CifFile module for Python
CifFile.nw                     Noweb file from which CifFile.py is obtained
CifFile.html                   Programming notes for CifFile derived also from
                               CifFile.nw
YappsCifParser.py              Cif parser automatically generated by Yapps2 
YappsCifParser.g               Grammar specifications for input to Yapps2
YappsCifParser.html            Programming notes for the grammar
YappsCifParser.nw              Literate format grammar notes
Makefile                       How to derive .html, .py and .g files from .nw files

Files derived from other programs:

yappsrt.py                     Yapps2 runtime support (Scanner etc.).  Part of the
                               Yapps2 distribution 

Installation
------------

All .py files should be placed in a directory where python can find them, for
example .../lib/python/site-packages/PyCifRW under Unix-type systems, and in
C:/Python20/Lib/PyCifRW for Windows.  Unix users should note that they will
need to create a one line file named 'PyCifRW.pth' in the site-packages directory 
containing the single word 'PyCifRW'.

Use
---

See the text in CifFile.html for details of the interface.

Example
-------

To read in a CIF:
>> from PyCifRW.CifFile import *
>> cf = CifFile('jun_01_2.cif')

to access information in a CIF

>> wav = cf['si_std']['_diffrn_meas_wavelength']

to set a value

>> cf['si_std']['_diffrn_meas_wavelength'] = 1.54
